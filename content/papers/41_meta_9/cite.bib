   abstract = {In this paper, we present a new Hyperfast Second-Order Method with convergence rate $$O(N^\{-5\})$$up to a logarithmic factor for the convex function with Lipshitz 3rd derivative. This method based on two ideas. The first comes from the superfast second-order scheme of Yu. Nesterov (CORE Discussion Paper 2020/07, 2020). It allows implementing the third-order scheme by solving subproblem using only the second-order oracle. This method converges with rate $$O(N^\{-4\})$$. The second idea comes from the work of Kamzolov et al. (arXiv:2002.01004). It is the inexact near-optimal third-order method. In this work, we improve its convergence and merge it with the scheme of solving subproblem using only the second-order oracle. As a result, we get convergence rate $$O(N^\{-5\})$$up to a logarithmic factor. This convergence rate is near-optimal and the best known up to this moment.},
