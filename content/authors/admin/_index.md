## About Me

Dmitry Kamzolov is a Research Associate at the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence ([MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae)). He is working at the Optimization and Machine Learning Lab ([OptML Lab](https://optmllab.github.io)) under the supervision of Prof. [Martin Tak√°ƒç](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qKQD-2cAAAAJ&hl=en). The main focus of the research is implementable second-order, higher-order, and Quasi-Newton methods for convex and non-convex optimization. Also, he has interest in adaptive stochastic methods, distributed optimization, federated learning, and various applications.
